            If you've never played War before, this may seem pretty confusing to you. Don't worry, though! I'll try to explain it to you as best as I can.
            War is a luck-based card game where the main objective is to win all of the cards. Each player starts off with 26 cards. Press the "Draw" button for you and player two to draw a card. If
            the card you draw is greater in value than the card that player 2 draws, then you get to keep your cards and take the card that player 2 just drew. If the card you draw is less in value than the card
            that player 2 draws, then player 2 gets to keep their cards and take the card that you just drew. Keep on drawing until either you or player 2 has the entire deck. Whoever has the entire deck is the
            winner!
